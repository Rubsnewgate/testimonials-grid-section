				I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned were current, if not

				I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make
				a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
				signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
				thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
				Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a
				Software Engineer at a VR startup.

				Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
				structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
				encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
				about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very
				hands-on and I never had to walt long for assistance. The agile team project, in
				particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way	that no
				tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
				example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
				full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!

				The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress wich I find really refreshing.
				The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and
				present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will
				get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
				people.
